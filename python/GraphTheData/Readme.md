This is a program that creates random data consisting of x,y coordinates. Then it will calculate the x mean, y mean, x standard deviation and y standard deviation.
Next it will change the data to look like an X by only changing the y values. 
Lastly, the program will move random points by their y value to get the above stats match.
Note: The first chart will display and only when the user closes that window, the calculation to change data to the X will occur. When it is complete the new chart will appear.
