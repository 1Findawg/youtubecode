PokerGame: This holds all of the game logic. The constructor launches the entire game. It will start with asking to add players. The players will see their hole cards and once all players are entered then the blinds and pre flop betting takes place. Next will be the flop cards being dealt. Then a round of betting. The turn card is follows with another round of betting. Lastly, the river card is dealt with a final round of betting. Then we find the winner by looking at all of the remaining player's hands. Who ever has the highest ranking hand wins. Ties are only considered for high card winners.
