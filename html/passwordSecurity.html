            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
                In order to keep your accounts as safe as possible online, there are some rules to follow.<br>
                1. Change your passwords often.<br>
                2. Make your passwords long.<br>
                3. Include letters, numbers and special characters.<br><br>
                This is not an exhaustive list by any means.<br><br>
                * DO NOT ENTER A PASSWORD YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING OR WILL USE IN THE FUTURE *<br><br>
                Below you will see that you can enter a password and a salt.
                The password input is the password that would be enetered for an account.
                The salt is a string of letters added to the password, typically at the end, that is created by the application and not the user.
                The password and salt are hashed. The hashed value is stored in the application database along with the salt. (This site does not save any information)
                Then when the user logs in again the application will get the password just enetered add the stored salt and hash it.
                Then it will check it against the stored hash value.<br><br>
                Below you will see the number of permutations possible based on the password length provided.<br>
                <strong>Numbers Only</strong>: [0-9]<br>
                <strong>One Case</strong>: [a-z] or [A-Z]<br>
                <strong>Uppercase and Lowercase</strong>: [a-z] and [A-Z]<br>
                <strong>Letters and Numbers</strong>: [0-9] and [a-z] and [A-Z]<br>
                <strong>Letters, Numbers and Special Characters</strong>: [0-9] and [a-z] and [A-Z] and [~`!@#$%^()-_=+{}\|;:'",./<>?"]
